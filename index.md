# FEMR - Fast Electronic Medical Records

### Description 

fEMR is a fast EMR solution for remote clinics who depend on speed and ease of use rather than complex features. Check out [Team fEMR's website](https://teamfemr.org) for more information and a live demo. Currently, fEMR relies on hardware and must provide physical servers to clients.  The client has to wait weeks before receiving the off-chain software, and fEMR needs to maintain an inventory of computers and handle shipping and returns. With our solution, the client will be able to download the off-chain software directly to their computer and cut out the hardware from fEMRâ€™s business.
